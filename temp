Dear Raj,
I hope this email finds you well. I wanted to share some positive news and discuss my professional development with you.
I'm pleased to inform you that I have successfully completed the Azure AI certification:
https://www.credly.com/badges/836ced97-19fe-408a-b693-c87c97e28297/linked_in?t=t1hr2l
Given this new certification and my experience over the past year, I would appreciate the opportunity to discuss my career trajectory and how I can best contribute to the organization moving forward.
After a year of working with the current team, I have concluded that there is a significant misalignment between the technical methodologies and technology stack being used and the industry best practices I have developed throughout my professional career. This situation prevents me from effectively leveraging my skills and contributing at my full potential. I believe a change would benefit both my professional development and the organization.
I would like to explore the following options with you:

Internal reassignment: Leveraging my new Azure AI certification, I would be interested in opportunities that align more closely with this expertise.
Other positions within the organization: I noticed there are Java developer and data engineer positions available in Zurich on the Luxoft website. I would appreciate guidance on whether internal applications for these roles would be possible.

I value the opportunities this organization has provided and would prefer to continue contributing here in a role that better matches my technical background and career goals.
Would you have time for a meeting in the coming week to discuss these possibilities?
Thank you for your consideration.
Best regards,
[Your name]
